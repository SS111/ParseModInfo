ParseModInfo
============

A makeshift C# JSON parser specifically made for parsing Minecraft Forge's mcmod.info files.

Please note, this was made for my [Minecraft toolkit] (http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1855860-pc-rks-toolkit-a-server-creator-mod-installer-and-skin-stealer/) and is not perfect, but it does it's job.
